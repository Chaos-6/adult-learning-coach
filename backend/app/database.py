"""
Database connection and session management.

Key concepts:
- We use SQLAlchemy 2.0's async API with asyncpg driver
- AsyncSession gives us non-blocking database calls (important for a web server
  handling many concurrent requests)
- get_db() is a "dependency" that FastAPI injects into route handlers —
  it provides a session and ensures cleanup after each request
